=======

wePoker is a multi-player poker game for Android that allows collocated people to play a game of Poker.
wePoker does not need a connection to the internet, everything happens using local communication technology.
On newer devices, wePoker will even use Wifi-Direct and NFC!

wePoker won the 'best app' award at the V Hack Android Belgium Hackathon in October 2012.
